    <h2>Here is the mercator projection. This projection essentially shows the world in a square. According 
        to our analysis, the projection skews the map as you go closer to the poles. This is why Greenland 
        looks larger than Africa.</h2>

    </h2>
    <h2>This is the robinson projeciton. This projection fixes a lot of the skewing that we see in the mercator projection. Greenland is no longer 
        larger than Africa. However, there is skewing that happens towards the poles as well. The circles from our analysis start to look like 
        ovals instead of circles.</h2>

    </h2>
    <h2>Here is the polyconic projection that I found. It looks pretty insanse, but it's also interesting
        to analyze. It looks like this projection is trying to show a globe on a flat surface to the best
        of its ability. To do this, it connects the poles as a circle at the top, but the ends of the Earth
        extend at the sides like wings. Really cool projection, but not very practical.

        </a>
    </h2>
    <h2>This is the stereographic projection. It seems like a mix of the mercator and robinson projections,
        where the analyis circles skew to be both bigger and more ovular.</h2>
