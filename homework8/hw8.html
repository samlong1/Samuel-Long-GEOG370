<h1>Homework 8: GeoProcessing in Real Life </h1>
<h2>Samuel Long</h2>
<h3>For this homework, I asked the question: what portions of major North Carolina rivers are within 10km of a coal ash structural fill? Coal ash has proven to be a dangerous carcinogen and I wanted to find out if there is any possibility of these structural fills polluting our watersheds. A good portion of our rivers are within this 10km limit that I set, so the red areas of the rivers are where the risks for pollution are likely greater.  </h3>
<h3>In order to make this map, I first found the data for the coal ash structural fill sites and the North Carolina major rivers. Then, I created a 10000m buffer around these sites. After the buffer was created, I made an intersection in order to show which portions of the major rivers were within 10km of a coal ash structural fill site. I removed the coal ash site buffer to clean the map up and make it easier to look at, but it was still used.</h3>
